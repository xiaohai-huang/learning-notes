> This study plan is for those who want to prepare for technical interviews but are uncertain which problems they should focus on. The problems have been carefully curated so that levels 1 and 2 will guide beginner and intermediate users through problems that cover the data structures and algorithms necessary to succeed in interviews with most mid-tier companies. While level 3 provides material to help users whose targets are top-tier companies.

## Day 1 Prefix Sum

### 1480. Running Sum of 1d Array

src: [https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array](https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/)

<JSEditor run={false}>{solution1}</JSEditor>

### 724. Find Pivot Index

src: [https://leetcode.com/problems/find-pivot-index](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-pivot-index/)

:::note

At a given index `i`, how do I get the value of `leftSum` and `rightSum`?

Ans:

- `leftSum` of **i**-th element can be computed by **summing** up all the values on the left of the **i**-th element.
- `rightSum` of **i**-th element is equal to the sum of the array **minus** the value of the current element **and** `leftSum`.

## Day 2 String

### 205. Isomorphic Strings

src: [https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/)

:::note

Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

:::

Should pay more attention on the last paragraph of the requirement. A character can only be mapped to one character. Therefore, create a set to store the `values`. i.e. **one-to-one** relationship.

|    input     | map                                                                   | result  |
| :----------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
|  egg -> add  | `{e : a, g : d}`                                                      | `true`  |
| badc -> baba | <ol><li>b -> b</li><li>a -> a</li><li>d -> b</li><li>c -> a</li></ol> | `false` |

For "badc -> baba", it has two characters that map to b (**b** and **d**) so it is not isomorphic.

<JSEditor run={false}>{solution3}</JSEditor>

### 392. Is Subsequence

src: [https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)

:::note

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

:::

A simple example `isSubsequence("bc", "abagdc")`

First, check if `b` in the string if it does exist then check the **remaining characters** to see if `c` exist.

## Day 3 Linked List

### 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

src: [https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)

<JSEditor run={false}>{solution5}</JSEditor>

### 206. Reverse Linked List

src: [https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

![reverse linked list](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev1ex1.jpg)

:::tip

Change each node's **next** pointer to its left node.

`null <- 1 <- 2 <- 3`

:::

<JSEditor run={false}>{solution6}</JSEditor>

## Day 4 Linked List

### 876. Middle of the Linked List

src: [https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)

:::note

Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

**Example 1**

![example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-midlist1.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
```

**Example 2**

![example 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-midlist2.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
```

:::

:::tip

**Fast and Slow Pointer**

When traversing the list with a pointer slow, make another pointer fast that traverses **twice as fast**.

- `slow = slow.next`
- `fast = fast.next.next`

When fast reaches the end of the list, slow must be in the middle.

### 142. Linked List Cycle II

src: [https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/)

:::note

Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`.

:::

<JSEditor run={false}>{solution8}</JSEditor>

## Day 5 Greedy

### 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

src: [https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

Two import information to keep track of:

- min price
- max profit

<JSEditor run={false}>{solution9}</JSEditor>

### 409. Longest Palindrome

src: [https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome/)

:::note

Given a string s which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters,
return the length of the **longest palindrome** that **can be built** with those letters.

:::

Imagine we build a palindrome string, it will have as many as _partnered letters_ as possible,
plus possibly a unique **center** character.

- If the number of occurrences of a letter is **even**, add the count to the total length of the palindrome.
- If the number of occurrences of a letter is **odd**, subtract the count by 1 and add it to the total length of the palindrome.
- If the palindrome haven't added a unique character to the center, add 1 to the length of the palindrome if a character with the number of occurrences equals 1 is found.
  - e.g. `{b : 2, f : 1, c : 1}`, `f` can be added to the center of the palindrome and it is the only character that is unique.

:::caution

- We can only insert 1 unique character and it has to be at the center.
- `aa`, `abba` are palindrome strings. The center of the palindrome can have 2 characters.

## Day 6 Tree

### 589. N-ary Tree Preorder Traversal

src: [https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-preorder-traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-preorder-traversal/)

:::note

![example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/narytreeexample.png)

- Input: root = `[1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]`
- Output: `[1,3,5,6,2,4]`

:::

Pre-order traversal is `root -> left -> right`.

<JSEditor run={false}>{solution11}</JSEditor>

### 102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

src: [https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/)

:::note

![level order traversal example](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/tree1.jpg)

- Input: root = `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`
- Output: `[[3],[9,20],[15,7]]`

:::

- Enqueue all nodes of a level.
- Process the tree level-by-level.
  - Enqueue all children of each node in the current level.
  - How to process level-by-level? This is achieved by checking the number of nodes in a level before processing a level.

<JSEditor run={false}>{solution12}</JSEditor>

## Day 7 Binary Search

### 704. Binary Search

src: [https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)

:::note

Given an array of integers `nums` which is sorted in **ascending order**, and an integer `target`,
write a function to search `target` in `nums`.
If `target` exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.

```
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
```

```
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
```

### 278. First Bad Version

src: [https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/)

<JSEditor run={false}>{solution14}</JSEditor>
