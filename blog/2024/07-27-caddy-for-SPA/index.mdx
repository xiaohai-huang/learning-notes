To set up Caddy for serving a Single Page Application (SPA) like a React app with react-router, you need to handle routing such that all navigation requests are routed to `index.html`, while also serving the static assets correctly.

## Directory Structure on Remote Storage

The **build** folder is stored at **http://my-minio-server:9000/website/short-videos** (_S3 bucket_) which contains the `index.html` and `js`/`css` files. see below for examples

- **http://my-minio-server:9000/website/short-videos/index.html**
- **http://my-minio-server:9000/website/short-videos/assets/xxx.js**

## Caddy Configuration

The goal is to serve the React app at **shorts.xiaohai-huang.net**, with the build output of the app stored on remote storage as mentioned above.

Below is a Caddy configuration to serve your SPA correctly:

```
shorts.xiaohai-huang.net {
    rewrite * /website/short-videos{uri}
    reverse_proxy my-minio-server:9000 {
        @error status 404
        handle_response @error {
            rewrite * /website/short-videos/index.html
            reverse_proxy my-minio-server:9000
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. Site Address: The `shorts.xiaohai-huang.net` is your site's domain.
1. Rewrite Rule: The `rewrite * /website/short-videos{uri}` ensures that all requests are rewritten to include the path to your build folder on the MinIO server.
1. Reverse Proxy: The `reverse_proxy my-minio-server:9000` forwards requests to your MinIO server.
1. Error Handling: The `@error status 404` block handles **404** errors. If a requested URL is not found (common with SPAs), it rewrites the request to index.html, ensuring that the React app's routing can take over.

:::info

It is often necessary to override the **Host** header with the configured upstream address when proxying to **HTTPS**, such that the **Host** header matches the **TLS** ServerName value.

```
reverse_proxy https://example.com {
	header_up Host {upstream_hostport}
}
```

:::note

In this example, the app is served at the index route (**shorts.xiaohai-huang.net**) aka. `/` . So the `base` public path of the react app should be set to `/` in your react build config.
