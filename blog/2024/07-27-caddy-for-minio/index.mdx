In this guide, we'll configure Caddy to serve as a reverse proxy for Minio, an object storage server. This setup will allow you to access the Minio console and the object storage service through Caddy.

## Caddy Configuration

```
storage.xiaohai-huang.net {
    redir /minio-console /minio-console/
    handle_path /minio-console/* {
        reverse_proxy my-minio-server:9001
    }

    handle_path /* {
        reverse_proxy my-minio-server:9000
    }
}
```

:::note

You can remove the `redir` line if the Minio container specifies the console path as **/minio-console/** (the trailing slash is needed)

:::

## Conclusion

With this configuration, Caddy will route traffic to the appropriate Minio services, making it easy to manage your object storage setup.
