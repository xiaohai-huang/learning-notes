# What's a Preload Scanner?

> By default, JavaScript execution is "parser blocking": when the browser encounters a script in the document it must pause DOM construction, hand over control to the JavaScript runtime, and let the script execute before proceeding with DOM construction.

Every browser has a primary HTML parser that tokenizes raw markup and processes it into [an object model](./00-how-browsers-work.md#dom). The parser will pause when it finds a blocking resource, such as a stylesheet loaded with a `<link>` element, or `<script>` without an `async` or `defer` attribute.

:::info

Why does browsers block parsing and rendering of the page?

**Ans:** The reason for this is that the browser can't know for sure if any given script will modify the DOM while the **primary HTML parser** is still doing its job.

    <strong>Fig. 1:</strong> A diagram depicting how the preload scanner works
    in parallel with the primary HTML parser to speculatively load assets. Here,
    the primary HTML parser is blocked as it loads and processes CSS before it
    can begin processing image markup in the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element,
    but the preload scanner can look ahead in the raw markup to find that image
    resource and begin loading it before the primary HTML parser is unblocked.

A preload scanner's role is to examine raw markup in order to find resources to fetch before the primary HTML parser discover them.

:::caution

**CSS** files block both **rendering** and **parsing**.
