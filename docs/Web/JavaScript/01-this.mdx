## What is `this` ?

> `this` is a binding that is made when a function is invoked, what it references is determined by entirely by the **[call-site](#call-site)** where the function is called.
> When a function is invoked, an [execution context](/docs-todos) is created. It contains the following information:

- Where the function was called from (the [call stack](/docs-todos))
- How the function was invoked
- What parameters were passed
- `this`

One of the most important properties of [execution context](/docs-todos) is the `this` reference that will be used for the duration of that function call.

## How to determine call-site ? {#call-site}

[call-site](#call-site): The location in code where a function is called (not where it's declared).

Because [call stack](/docs-todos) is a stack of functions that have been called to get us to the current moment of execution. The call-site of a function is in the invocation _before_ the currently executing function. see the the image below

Insert a debugger at the code above

![call-site](./_assets/call-site.png)
In this example, the [call-site](#call-site) of function `foo` (currently executing function), is in `bar` line 16.

## Rules

### Default Binding

```js title="standalone function invocation"
function foo() {
  console.log(this.a);
}

var a = 2;

foo(); // 2
```

In `strict mode`, the global object is not eligible for the _default binding_.
