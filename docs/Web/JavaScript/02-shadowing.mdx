## What is shadowing ?

When you have two or more variables, each in different scope, with the same lexical names.

<JSEditor run={false}>{firstExample}</JSEditor>

The `city` variable (parameter) at line 3 shadows the variable `city` at line 1. That's why re-assignment of `city` at line 4 only affects the **inner variable**, not the outer one.

## Illegal Shadowing

Not all combinations of declaration shadowing are allowed. `let` can shadow `var`, but `var` cannot shadow `let`

<JSEditor>{secondExample}</JSEditor>

`var` at line 4 is trying to '**cross the boundary**' of `let` declaration.

<JSEditor title="valid. if there is a function boundary in between">
  {thirdExample}
</JSEditor>
