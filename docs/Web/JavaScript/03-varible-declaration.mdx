## `var`

### Scope of `var`

`var` declarations are **global** or **function** scope.

#### Global Scope

The scope is global when `var` variable is declared outside of a function.

```js title="Global Scope"
var myVar = "Global Variable";
console.log(myVar); // Global Variable
console.log(window.myVar); // Global Variable
```

#### Function Scope

The scope is function scope when `var` variable is declared inside a function. This means that it is only available within that function.

#### Re-declared and Updated

[Re-declaration?](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/2nd-ed/scope-closures/ch5.md#re-declaration)

`var` variable can be re-declared and updated

:::note

A repeated `var` declaration of the same identifier name in a scope is effectively a do-nothing operation.

<JSEditor title="repeated var">{thirdExample}</JSEditor>

```js title="After 'pre-process' repeated var"
var studentName;
var studentName; // pointless, no-op

studentName = "Frank";
console.log(studentName);
// Frank

console.log(studentName); // Frank
```

### Hoisting of `var`

[Hoisting: Yet Another Metaphor](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/2nd-ed/scope-closures/ch5.md#hoisting-yet-another-metaphor)

It is useful to think of hoisting as a series of actions JS takes in setting up the program **before execution**.

1. The identifier is hoisted to the top of the scope
2. It's automatically initialized to the value `undefined`. So that the variable can be used throughout the entire scope.

```js title="Before 'pre-process'"
age = 20;
console.log(age);
// 20
var age = 30;
```

```js title="After 'pre-process'" {3}
var age; // hoisted declaration

age = 20;
console.log(age);
age = 30;
```

:::info

However, `function` declarations are entirely hoisted to the top of each scope. And they are hoisted first, then variables are hoisted immediately after all the functions.

```js title="Before 'pre-process'"
age = 20;
sayAge(); // age is 20

function sayAge() {
  console.log(`age is ${age}`);
}
var age;
```

```js title="After 'pre-process'"
function sayAge() {
  console.log(`age is ${age}`);
}
var age;

age = 20;
sayAge(); // age is 20
```
