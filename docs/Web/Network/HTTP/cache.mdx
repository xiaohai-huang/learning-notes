# HTTP Cache

Fetching resources over the network is both slow and expensive:

- If a person is accessing your site with a limited mobile data plan, every unnecessary network request is a waste of their money.
- Large responses (_image/audio_) require many roundtrip between the browser and the server.

How can we avoid unnecessary network requests? The HTTP cache can be helpful.

The HTTP cache stores a response associated with a request and reuses the stored response for subsequent requests.

## Cache Key

A cache key is composed from, at a minimum:

- request method
- target URI

:::info

Many HTTP caches only cache `GET` responses and therefore only use the URI as the cache key.

Most commonly, caches stores the successful result of a retrieval request: i.e., a 200 (OK) response to a `GET` request, which contains a representation of the target resource.

However, it is also possible to store redirects, negative results (e.g., **404 (Not Found)**), incomplete results (e.g., **206(Partial Content)**), and responses to other methods other than `GET`.

:::

### Vary

`Vary` expands the [cache key](#cache-key) required to match a new request to the stored cache entry.

A cache might store multiple responses for a request target that is subject to _content negotiation_. Caches differentiate these responses by incorporating some of the original request's header fields into the **cache key**, using information in the `Vary` response header field.

  <figcaption>Cache keys incorporating Accept-Language.</figcaption>

```http
Vary: accept-encoding, accept-language
```

:::note

A stored response with a `Vary` header field value containing a member "\*" always fails to match.

:::

## Freshness

Stored HTTP responses have two states: **fresh** or **stale**.

A _fresh_ response is one whose **age** has not yet exceeded its [freshness lifetime](#freshness-lifetime). While a _stale_ response is one that has already expired.

### Age

The `Age` field value is the cache's estimate of the number of seconds since the origin server generated or validated the response.

> `Age` is the time elapsed since the response was generated.

### Freshness Lifetime

A cache can calculate the **freshness lifetime** of a response by evaluating the following rules and using the first match:

1. If the cache is **shared** and the `s-maxage` response directive is present, use its value.
2. If the `max-age` response directive is present, use its value.
3. If the `Expires` response header field is present, use its value minus the value of the `Date` response header field.
4. If no explicit expiration time is present in the response. A heuristic freshness lifetime might be applicable.

## Validation

Stale responses are not immediately discarded. The conditional request mechanism can transform a stale response into a fresh one by asking the origin server, or to replace the stored response(s) with a new response. This process is known as _validating_ or _revalidating_ the stored response.

### Sending a Validation Request

When generating a conditional request for validation, a cache synthesizes a request using a stored response by copying the method, target URI, and request header fields specified by the [Vary](#vary) header field.

The cache then updates the request with one or more **precondition header fields** which contain validators sourced from a stored response(s).

When generating a conditional request for validated, a cache:

- _MUST_ send the relevant entity tags (using `If-None-Match`, `If-Match`) if the entity tags (ETag) were provided in the stored response(s) being validated.
- _SHOULD_ send the `Last-Modified` value (using `If-Modified-Since`) if the request is not for a subrange, and that response contains a `Last-Modified` value.

The precondition header fields are compared by recipients (servers) to determine whether the stored response is equivalent to the current representation of the resource.

:::info

Resource metadata is referred to as a _validator_ if it can be used within a precondition to make a conditional request.

There are two forms of metadata:

- modification dates
- opaque entity tags (clearly superior)

:::

The precondition header fields can contain two different types of **validators**.

#### Timestamp

One validator is the timestamp given in a `Last-Modified` header field, which can be used in an `If-Modified-Since` header field for response validation.

:::info

The `Last-Modified` header field in a response provides a timestamp indicating the date and time at which the origin server believes the selected representation was last modified.

```
Last-Modified: Tue, 15 Nov 1994 12:45:26 GMT
```

:::

#### Entity Tag (ETag) {#etag}

Another validator is the entity tag given in an `ETag` field. One or more entity tags, indicating one or more stored responses, can be used in an `If-None-Match` header field for response validation.

##### Example

A response, an HTML file, has a `ETag` value of `33a64df5`.

```bash title="response of /index.html"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 1024
Date: Tue, 22 Feb 2022 22:22:22 GMT
ETag: "33a64df5"
Cache-Control: max-age=3600
```

If that response is stale, the client takes the value of the `ETag` from the response header of the cached response, and puts it into the `If-None-Match` request header of the validation request, to ask the server if the resource has been modified.

```bash title="A conditional request for validation"
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: text/html
If-None-Match: "33a64df5"
```

see below for how to handle the validation response.

### Handling a Validation Response

A cache handles a response to a conditional request by considering its status code:

- A **304 (Not Modified)** response status code indicates that the stored response can be updated and reused.
- A full response (i.e., one containing content) indicates that none of the stored responses nominated in the conditional request are suitable. Therefore, the cache _MUST_ use the full response to satisfy the request. The cache _MAY_ store the full response.

## Field Definitions

This section discusses the HTTP fields related to caching.

### Age

The `Age` response header filed is the time elapsed since the response was generated or successfully validated at the origin server.

### Cache-Control

The `Cache-Control` header field is used to list directives for caches. Cache directives are **unidirectional**👽️, the presence of a directive in a **request** does not imply that the same directive is present or copied in the **response**.

:::warning

The [request directives](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9111.html#cache-request-directive) are advisory, caches _MAY_ implement them, but are not required to. So our primary focus is on **response directives**, a cache _MUST_ obey the `Cache-Control` directives in response.

:::

#### `max-age`

The `max-age` response directive indicates that the response is to be considered stale after its [age](#age) is greater than the specified number of seconds.

#### `must-revalidate`

The `must-revalidate` response directive indicates that once the response has become stale, a cache _MUST NOT_ reuse that response to satisfy another request until it has been successfully validated by the origin.

If a cache is disconnected, a cache _MUST_ generate an error response rather than reuse the stale response. The generated status code _SHOULD_ be **504 (Gateway Timeout)** unless another error status code is more applicable.

#### `no-cache`

The `no-cache` response directive indicates that the response _MUST NOT_ be used to satisfy any other request without forwarding it for validation and receiving a successful response.

This allows an origin server to prevent a cache from using response to satisfy a request without contacting it.

#### `no-store` ⛔️ {#no-store}

The `no-store` response directive indicates that a cache _MUST NOT_ store any part of either the intermediate request or the response and _MUST NOT_ use the response to satisfy any other request.

#### `private`

The `private` response directive indicates that a shared cache _MUST NOT_ store the response since the response is intended for a single user. It also indicates that a private cache _MAY_ store the response.

#### `public`

It permits a shared cache to reuse a response to a request containing an `Authorization` header field.

:::note

It is unnecessary to add the `public` directive to a response that is already cacheable.

:::

### Expires

The `Expires` response header field gives the date/time after which the response is considered stale.

```
Expires: Thu, 01 Dec 1994 16:00:00 GMT
```

:::note

If a response includes a [Cache-Control](#cache-control) header field with the [max-age](#max-age), a recipient _MUST_ ignore the `Expires` header field. Because the value in `Expires` is only intended for recipients that have not yet implemented the [Cache-Control](#cache-control) header field.

:::

## Heuristic Caching

Since origin servers do not always provide explicit expiration times, a cache _MAY_ assign a heuristic expiration time when an explicit time is not specified, employing algorithms that use other field values (such as the [Last-Modified](#last-modified) time) to estimate a plausible expiration time.

If the response has a [Last-Modified](#last-modified) header field, caches are encouraged to use a heuristic expiration value that is no more than some fraction of the interval since that time. A typical setting of this fraction might be 10%;

### Example

If a response has a [Last-Modified](#last-modified) header field set to 1 year ago.

```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 1024
Date: Tue, 22 Feb 2022 22:22:22 GMT
Last-Modified: Tue, 22 Feb 2021 22:22:22 GMT
```

The response will be stored in a cache and it is considered as fresh for 0.1 year.
