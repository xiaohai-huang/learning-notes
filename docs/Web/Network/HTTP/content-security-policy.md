Modify `<script>` tags to include a _nonce_ which changes on each response.

block inline script.
nonce-based CSP

### Trusted Types

`Content-Security-Policy: trusted-types myPolicy`

- Enforce type restrictions for unsafe DOM APIs.
- Create safe types in policy functions.

### Fetch Metadata Request Headers

> Let the server make security decisions based on the source and context of each HTTP request.

- Reject resource requests that come from unexpected resources.
- Use the following request headers:
  - `Sec-Fetch-Site`
  - `Sec-Fetch-Mode`

### Cross-Origin Opener Policy

`Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`

```js
const w = window.open("https://victim.example.com");
w.frame.length;
w.location = "jjj";
```
