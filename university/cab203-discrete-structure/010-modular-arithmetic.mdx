## Parity

Prity refers to the state of being _even_ or _odd_.

- Integers have one of two different parities:
  - $x$ is _even_ means $2|x$
  - $x$ is _odd_ means $2|(x-1)$
- Some properties:
  - even $\pm$ even = even
  - even $\pm$ odd = odd
  - odd $\pm$ odd = even

## Clock Arithmetic

Time _wraps_ around at 12. In addition, adding any multiple of 12 hours does not change the o'clock.

example 1: now is 10 o'clock. What time is it after 5 hours?

<center>3 o'clock</center>

example 2: what time is it after 27 hours from now? What time is it after 39 hours from now?

<JSEditor>
  console.log(27 % 12); console.log(39 % 12);console.log(15 % 12);
</JSEditor>

So `a` and `b` are the same o'clock if 12 divides `a - b` or `(a - b) % 12 == 0`

```js
const a = 15;
const b = 15 + 12 * 2; // 39
const result = (a - b) % 12;
console.log(result); // 0
```

## Modular Arithmetic

Modular arithmetic is an abstraction of [parity](#parity) and [clock arithmetic](#clock-arithmetic).

- **Parity** is arithmetic modulo 2
- **Clocks** use arithmetic modulo 12

### Modular Equivalence

Modular equivalence is also called **modualr congruence**.

Definition: $n | (a - b)$, if $a - b$ is divisible by $n$. Then $a$ and $b$ are _equivalent modulo n_.

$$
n | (a - b) \implies a \equiv b \ (\textrm{mod}\ n)
$$

Example:

$$
\begin{aligned}
a & = 50 \\
b & = 20 \\
n & = 10 \\
\\
\frac{a-b}{n} & = \frac{30}{10} = 3 \dots 0 \\
a & \equiv b \ (\textrm{mod}\ n)
\end{aligned}
$$

### Properties of Modular Arithmetic

Modualr equivalence plays nicely with ["addition", "subtraction", "multiplication"].

Suppose that $a_1 \equiv b_1 \ (\textrm{mod}\ n)$ and $a_2 \equiv b_2 \ (\textrm{mod}\ n)$. Then:

- $a_1 + a_2 \equiv b_1 + b_2 \ (\textrm{mod}\ n)$
- $a_1 - a_2 \equiv b_1 - b_2 \ (\textrm{mod}\ n)$
- $a_1 \times a_2 \equiv b_1 \times b_2 \ (\textrm{mod}\ n)$

This means we can use many tools from normal arithmetic with modular arithmetic.

### mod Operator

Definition: $a\ \textrm{mod}\ n$ is the smallest non-negative integer $c$ such that $a \equiv c\ (\textrm{mod}\ n)$.

Equivalently, $a\ \textrm{mod}\ n$ is the remainder when you divide $a$ by $n$ ($\frac{a}{n}$).

Example: $11\ \textrm{mod}\ 2 = 1$, because $11 = (5 \times 2) + 1$

### Proof of Lemma

> A **lemma** is little statement that is true in a mathematical theory,
> derived from its **axioms**. We can show that it is true by using a
> proof which shows the steps necessary to get from the axioms to
> the statement. We can also use other lemmas in the proof if we
> have already proved them.

Lemma: Let $a$ and $b$ be integers.
$a\ \textrm{mod}\ b = 0 \implies b|a$.

Proof:

1. According to the definition of [mod operator](#mod-operator), $a \equiv 0 \ (\textrm{mod}\ b)$.
2. Use [modular equivalence](#modular-equivalence) definition, $b | (a - 0)$
3. Based on a well known lemma, we known that $a - 0 = a$, so $b | a$

### Applications of Modular Arithmetic
