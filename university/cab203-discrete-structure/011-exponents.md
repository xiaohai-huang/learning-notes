Definition: The **exponent** of a number says **how many times** to use the number in a multiplication.

- Notation: $a^3$ means $a \times a \times a$.
- $a^n$ means multiply $a$ by $n$ times.
- $a$ is called the **base**.
- $n$ is called the **exponent**.

:::note
Negative exponent example:

$5^{-3}$ could be calculated like:

$$
\frac{1}{5^3} = \frac{1}{5 \times 5 \times 5}=\frac{1}{125}
$$

:::info
What if the Exponent is 0?

If the exponent is **0**, then the answer is **1**. (example $5^0 = 1$)

## Laws of Exponents

- $(ab)^n = a^n \times b^n$
- $a^m \times a^n = a^{m + n}$
- $a^{m - n} = \frac{a^m}{a^n}$ (when $a \not= 0$)
- $a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n}$ (when $a \not= 0$)
- $a^0 = 1$
- $(a^m)^n = a^{m \times n}$

## Important Exponents (powers of 2)

We often see a lot of powers of 2 in computer science. For example, Here are some prefixes:

| Prefix | Multiply By  |                    Number |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------------------: |
| kilo-  | $2^{10}$     |                     1,024 |
| mega-  | $(2^{10})^2$ |                 1,048,576 |
| giga-  | $(2^{10})^3$ |             1,073,741,824 |
| tera-  | $(2^{10})^4$ |         1,099,511,627,776 |
| peta-  | $(2^{10})^5$ |     1,125,899,906,842,624 |
| exa-   | $(2^{10})^6$ | 1,152,921,504,606,847,000 |

## Exponent Examples

- $2^{10}$ is the number of bytes in a kilobyte.
- $2^3 = 8$ is the number of bits in a byte.
- $2^{10} \times 2^{3} = 2^{10 + 3} = 8192$ is the number of bits in a kilobyte.
