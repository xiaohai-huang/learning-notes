Propositional Logic studies:

- [Propositions](#proposition)
- [Logical connectives](#logical-operators) that build larger propositions from smaller ones

:::info

**Logic** allows us to determine if a large proposition is `true` or `false` based on
how it is constructed and the truth value of the smaller pieces.

:::

## Proposition

A **proposition** is a statement that is either `true` or `false`.

Examples of _propositions_:

- "I like Dan" is `true`.
- "All humans are mortal" is `true`.
- $5 \in \{2x : x \in \mathbb{N}\}$ is `false`.

### Atomic and Compound Propositions

**Compound propositions** are composed of two or more atomic propositions.
**Atomic proposition** cannot be broken down.

- "It is raining" is **atomic**.
- "It is raining and cloudy" is a **compound proposition**. It contains two propositions "It is raining" and "It is cloudy".
- "If I hit my head then it will hurt" is **compound**. It contains the propositions "I hit my head" and "my head will hurt".

## Logical Operators

Compound propositions can be built by atomic propositions and logical operators (also called logical connectives). Some common operators:

| Operator       | Symbol     |
| -------------- | ---------- |
| NOT            | $\neg$     |
| AND            | $\land$    |
| OR             | $\lor$     |
| XOR            | $\oplus$   |
| IF...THEN      | $\implies$ |
| IF AND ONLY IF | $\iff$     |

### IF..THEN {#if-then}

"$p$ implies $q$" stands for "if $p$ then $q$".

$p \implies q$ is _logically equivalent_ to $\neg p \lor q$.

| $p$ | $q$ | $p \implies q$ |
| :-: | :-: | :------------: |
| $T$ | $T$ |      $T$       |
| $T$ | $F$ |      $F$       |
| $F$ | $T$ |      $T$       |
| $F$ | $F$ |      $T$       |

:::info

Use **vending machine** example to memorize this truth table.

- $p$ is the 💵.
- $q$ is the 🍗.

:::

### IF AND ONLY IF

$p \iff q$ is a **shorthand** for $(p \implies q) \land (q \implies p)$

| $p$ | $q$ | $p \iff q$ |
| :-: | :-: | :--------: |
| $T$ | $T$ |    $T$     |
| $T$ | $F$ |    $F$     |
| $F$ | $T$ |    $F$     |
| $F$ | $F$ |    $T$     |

:::info

If both operands are the **same** then it is `true`. Otherwise it is `false`.

:::

## Formula

To find the truth value of a formula:

1. Fill in the truth value for all variables.
2. Evaluate logical connectives from innermost parentheses outwards.

:::note

When $p = T$ and $q = F$

$$
\begin{aligned}
(p \lor q) \implies (q \oplus p) & = (T \lor F) \implies (F \oplus T) \\
& = T \implies T \\
& = T

\end{aligned}
$$

### Formula Classification

| Classification | Always `true` | Sometimes `true` | Always `false` |
| :------------: | :-----------: | :--------------: | :------------: |
|   Tautology    |      ✅       |        ❌        |       ❌       |
| Contradiction  |      ❌       |        ❌        |       ✅       |
|   Contingent   |      ❌       |        ✅        |       ❌       |
|  Satisfiable   |      ✅       |        ✅        |       ❌       |

```python
def classify(func):
    propositions = [True, False]
    results = []
    for p in propositions:
        for q in propositions:
            results.append(func(p, q))

    num_elements = len(results)
    num_T = 0
    num_F = 0
    for result in results:
        if result == True:
            num_T += 1
        else:
            num_F += 1
    if num_T == num_elements:
    # if all True -> Tautology
        return "Tautology"
    elif num_F == num_elements:
    # if all False -> Contradiction
        return "Contradiction"
    else:
    # can be T or F -> Contingent
        return "Contingent"
```

### Tautology

Always `true`. And also [satisfiable](#satisfiable).

- $T$
- $\neg F$
- $A \lor \neg A$
- $\neg (A \land \neg A)$
- $(A \land (A \implies B)) \implies B$

### Contradiction

Always `false`. **NOT** satisfiable.

- $F$
- $\neg T$
- $A \land \neg A$
- $(A \land (A \implies B)) \implies \neg B$

### Contingent

Can be `true` or `false` depending on the variables. Also [satisfiable](#satisfiable).

- $A \lor B$
- $A \implies B$

Have a look at the [truth table](#if-then) of $A \implies B$.

### Satisfiable

Satisfiable formulas are either tautologies or contingent formulas.

## Logical Equivalence

Some formulas are _logically equivalent_ meaning that they are always the same given any variables.

In other words, two statements are _logically equivalent_ if, and only if, their resulting truth tables are identical for each variation of variables.

e.g. $A \implies B$ is logically equivalent to $\neg A \lor B$.

So we can write $A \implies B \equiv \neg A \lor B$.

:::info

Saying $A \equiv B$ is the same as saying that $A \iff B$ is a [tautology](#tautology).

:::

```python
def test_logical_equivalence(func_1, func_2):
    propositions = [True, False]

    for p in propositions:
        for q in propositions:
            if func_1(p, q) != func_2(p, q):
                print("Not logically equivalent")
                return False
    print("Logically equivalent")
    return True
```
