We can define sets in 3 ways.

- Listing elements.

  $\text{SimplePrimes} = \{1,2,3,5,7 \}$

- Set Builder notation (set comprehension).

  $\text{SQUARES} = \{x \in 	\mathbb{Z} : x = y^2 \text{ for some } y \in \mathbb{Z} \}$

- A list with implied pattern.

  $\text{EVENS} = \{2,4,6,8, \dots \}$

## Common Sets

| Description                   | Notation                                           |
| :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| Integers                      | $\mathbb{Z} = \{\ldots -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots\}$  |
| Positive Integers             | $\mathbb{Z}^{+} = \{1,2,3, \ldots\}$               |
| Non-Negative Integers         | $\mathbb{Z}_{	\geq 0} = \{0, 1,2,3, \ldots\}$       |
| Rationals                     | $\mathbb{Q}= \{\frac{x}{y}: x,y \in \mathbb{Z} \}$ |
| Real Numbers                  | $\mathbb{R}$                                       |
| Set of Numbers. 1 through $n$ | $n:[n] = \{1,\ldots , n\}$                         |
| Empty Set (no elements)       | $\empty = \{ \}$                                   |

**0** is not positive.

## Membership

How to check whether an element $x$ is in a set $S$?

- Checking whether $x$ in the list, if $S$ is given **explicitly**.
- Checking whether $x$ satisfies the conditions, if $S$ is given in [Set Builder Notation](#).
- Checking whether $x$ satisfies the implied condition, for sets given like $\{1,2,\ldots\}$

:::note
Membership Examples:

- $1 \in \{1,2,3\}$
- $12 \in \{x \in \mathbb{Z} : x \text{ divides } 60\}$ because 12 is an integer & 12 divides 60.
- $15 \in \{1,3,5,\ldots\}$ the implied condition is "odd numbers".

:::

:::danger

**implied** conditions are bad!

:::

## Equality of Sets

Two sets are considered to be equal if they contain the **same** elements.

e.g. $S = T$, when:

- Every element $x \in S$ is in $T$. aka. Every element of $S$ is also in $T$.
- Every element $x \in T$ is in $S$. aka. Every element of $T$ is also in $S$.

Another equivalent definition using [subset](#subset):

- $S \subseteq T$
- $T \subseteq S$

:::note

Are these the same?

- $\{1,2,3\}$ is the same set as $\{3,2,1\}$ (**order** doesn't matter).
- $\{1,1,1\}$ is the same set as $\{1\}$ (don't **count** multiples).
- $\{x \in \mathbb{Z}: x^2 = 4\}$ is the same as $\{2, -2\}$.

:::

## Size of Sets

The size of a set is denoted as $|S|$ which is the number of **distinct** elements in the set.

- $|\{1,2,3\}| = 3$
- $|\{1,1,1\}| = 1$
- $|\{\text{üÉè},\text{üíé},\text{üíó}\}| = 3$

## Subset

$A$ is a **subset** of $B$, if every $x \in A$ is in $B$.

$$
A \subseteq B
$$

$A$ is a **proper subset** of $B$, if $A$ is a **subset** of $B$ and not equal to $B$.

$$
A \subset B
$$

:::info

$A \subset B \equiv A \subseteq B \land A \not = B$

:::

The set of _all subsets_ of a set $S$ is called the **power set** of $S$,
written $P(S)$.

$$
P(\{1,2\}) = \{\empty, \{1\},\{2\},\{1,2\}  \}
$$

:::info

- The empty set is a subset of all set.
- The set itself is also a subset of itself.

:::

## Set Builder Notation

There are two general forms that we can use for Set Builder Notation.

### Set Comprehension

Specify a base set, and test if the element match the condition. (`Array.filter()`)

$$
\{x \in S: filter(x)\}
$$

$$
\text{SQUARES} = \{x \in \mathbb{Z}: x = y^2 \text{ for some } y\in \mathbb{Z}\}
$$

### Replacement

Apply a function to each member of a set and collect the results. (like `Array.map()`)

$$
\{f(x): x \in S \}
$$

$$
\text{SQUARES} = \{x^2: x \in \mathbb{Z}\}
$$

:::caution

These two constructions **cannot** generate sets than are larger than the original sets.

:::

### Set Builder Examples

- $\{x \in \mathbb{Z}: x = 2y \text{ for some } y \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ is every **integer** that
  is **an integer multiples by 2**, i.e. the even numbers.
- $\{2x: x\in \mathbb{Z}\}$ is every integer times 2. i.e. the even numbers.
- $\{x \in \mathbb{R}: 2x \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ are the real numbers that becomes integer after multiplying by 2.

  i.e. $\{\ldots -1.5, -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, \ldots \}$

## Set Operations

Set operations consists of union, intersection, and difference.

### Union

Include every element in both sets.

$$
A \cup B = \{x: x \in A \lor x \in B\}
$$

:::info
The real definition: we define $A \cup B$ to be the smallest set $S$ such that
$A \subseteq S$ and $B \subseteq S$.
:::

### Intersection

Only include elements that exist in the both sets.

$$
A \cap B = \{x \in A : x \in B\}
$$

### Difference

Remove elements in $A$ that are in $B$.

$$
A \setminus  B = \{x \in A : x \not \in B \}
$$

:::note Example
Set $A = \{1,2,3\}$ and $B = \{1,3,5\}$. Then:

- $A \cup B = \{1,2,3,5\}$
- $A \cap B = \{1,3\}$
- $A \setminus B = \{2\}$

:::

## Universe Set

The **universe set** $U$ is the set of all elements that we care about.

Benefits:

1. Allow us to define _complements_.
2. Allow us to use set comprehensions without specifying the set to draw elements from.

:::note Example

With $U = \mathbb{Z}^{+}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \text{COMPOSITES} & = \overline{\text{PRIMES}} \\
  \text{EVENS} & = \{x: x = 2y \} \\
  \text{ODDS} & = \overline{\text{EVENS}} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

## Venn Diagram

Venn diagrams are used for showing the relationship between sets.

For more about Venn diagrams, visit [Math is Fun](https://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/venn-diagrams.html)
or [lecture notes](https://github.com/xiaohai-huang/resources/blob/master/QUT/Discrete-Structure/week4/lecture04.pdf)

## Characteristic Vector

## Sets in Python

```python title="Basic Set Operations"
S = {1, 2, 3}
T = {1, 3, 5}

S.add(4)
S.remove(4)

S.union(T)
S.intersection(T)
S.issubset({1, 2})

print(1 in S)
print(S - T) # { 2 }
print(T <= S) # Is T a subset of S?
print(S.isdisjoint(T)) # Is S intersect T empty?

```

Python uses a combined [comprehension](#set-comprehension) and [replacement](#replacement) notation for Set Builder notation.

```python title="Set Comprehension"
S = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
def filter(x): return x % 2 == 0
def transform(x): return x * 5

new_S = { transform(x) for x in S if filter(x) }

temp_S =  { x     for x in range(0, 10) if x % 2 == 0 } # {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
new_S =   { x * 5 for x in range(0, 10) if x % 2 == 0 } # {0, 40, 10, 20, 30}
```
