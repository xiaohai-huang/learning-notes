**Syllogisms** are a kind of _deductive reasoning_ about sets.
A simple syllogism definition is that it's a form of deductive reasoning where you arrive at a specific conclusion by examining premises or ideas.

Many Syllogisms contain 3 components:

1. Major premise
2. Minor premise
3. Conclusion

**Deductive reasoning** is a logical approach where you progress from general ideas to specific conclusions.

It's often contrasted with **inductive reasoning**,
where you start with specific observations and form general conclusions.

Deductive reasoning is also called deductive logic or top-down reasoning.
