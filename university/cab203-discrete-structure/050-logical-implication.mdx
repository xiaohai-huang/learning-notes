From one `true` proposition we can derive other true propositions.
This is called **logical Implication**.

:::note Examples

- From $A \land B$ we can conclude $A$.
- From $(A \implies B) \land A$ we can conclude B.

:::

If from $A$ we can conclude $B$, then we write $A \models B$,
which is equivalent to saying that $A \implies B$ is [tautology](030-propositional-logic.mdx#tautology).

:::note More Examples

- $A \land B \models A$
- $A \models A \lor B$
- $(A \implies B) \land A \models B$
- $(A \implies B) \land (B \implies C) \models A \implies C$
- $(A \lor B) \land \lnot A \models B$

## Find Logical implications

We can find logical implications in two ways:

1. Using a [truth table](#logical-implication-truth-table).
2. Using a proof

### Logical Implication Truth Table

Two methods to find logical implications using truth table.

- **Method 1**: Check the rows where LHS is `true`.
- **Method 2**: Use the property $A \models B$ is equivalent to $A \implies B$ is [tautology](030-propositional-logic.mdx#tautology).

To show that $A \models A \lor B$

#### Method 1

1. Draw a truth table.

   | $A$ | $B$ | $A \lor B$ |
   | :-: | :-: | :--------: |
   | $T$ | $T$ |    $T$     |
   | $T$ | $F$ |    $T$     |
   | $F$ | $T$ |    $T$     |
   | $F$ | $F$ |    $F$     |

2. Only check the **rows** when $A$ is `true`.

   If $A$ is `true` and $A \lor B$ is also `true`, then we can say that $A$ logically implies $A \lor B$.

#### Method 2

Because $A \models B$ is the same as say $A \implies B$ is a [tautology](030-propositional-logic.mdx#tautology).

We can show $A \models A \lor B$ using the property above.

1. Draw a truth table. Including an extra column $A \implies A \lor B$.

   | $A$ | $B$ | $A \lor B$ | $A \implies A \lor B$ |
   | :-: | :-: | :--------: | :-------------------: |
   | $T$ | $T$ |    $T$     |          $T$          |
   | $T$ | $F$ |    $T$     |          $T$          |
   | $F$ | $T$ |    $T$     |          $T$          |
   | $F$ | $F$ |    $F$     |          $T$          |

2. $A \implies A \lor B$ is `true` in all cases, so logical implication is `true`.

:::info

**Logical implication** is not symmetric. And it is different from **[logical equivalence](030-propositional-logic.mdx#logical-equivalence)**.

:::

### Proof

## How to Use Logical Implication

**Substitution**. But unlike **[logical equivalence](030-propositional-logic.mdx#logical-equivalence)**,
it is not always safe to make substitutions with logical implications.

### Safe Substitution

Only **substitute** using a logical implication if the _left hand side_ is known to be `true`.

:::note Example

- We have $A \land B \models A$, so if $A \land B$ is `true`, we can replace it with $A$.
- $A$ = "It is raining"
- $B$ = "It is cloudy"
- If "It is raining and cloudy" is `true`, we can replace that with "It is cloudy".

:::

### Unsafe Substitution

What would happen if the _left hand side_ is `false`?

- Use $A \land B \models A$ substitute into $\lnot (A \land B)$, to get $\lnot A$.
- $A$ = "Socrates is human"
- $B$ = "Socrates is a teapot"
- From "**NOT** (Socrates is human and a teapot)" ($A \land B$), we cannot conclude that "Socrates is **not** human" ($\lnot A$).

## Logical Equivalence vs. Logical Implication

| $P \equiv Q$                                 | $P \models Q$                                           |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| $P$ and $Q$ always have the same truth value | $Q$ is `true` whenever $P$ is `true`                    |
| Can make substitutions (not restrictions)    | Can only safely make substitutions when $P$ is `true`   |
| Truth table: Two columns are identical       | Truth table: In rows where $P$ are $T$, $Q$ is also $T$ |
| $P \iff Q$ is a tautology                    | $P \implies Q$ is a tautology                           |
