## Parameters and Predicates

## Quantifiers

**Quantifiers** are symbols that allow us to talk about parameters in predicates.

Two kinds:

- [Existential Quantification](#existential-quantification) (there exists)
- [Universal Quantification](#universal-quantification) (for all)

:::info

**Quantifiers** allow us to form **propositions** out of _predicates_
without filling in any specific value for parameters.

:::

### Existential Quantification

The _existential quantifier_ has the symbol $\exists$ and means "there exists".

$$
\exists x \in \mathbb{Z}(x^2 = 4)
$$

The above expression means that "There exists $x$ from $\mathbb{Z}$ such that $x^2 = 4$."

:::tip

We don't get to known which value of $x$ works, just that some value of $x$ works.

#### Truth Value With Existential Quantifiers

### Universal Quantification

The _universal quantifier_ has the symbol $\forall$ and means "for all".

$$
\forall x \in \mathbb{Z}( x^2 \geq 0)
$$

The above expression means that "For every $x$ in $\mathbb{Z}$, $x^2 \geq 0$ is always `true`".
