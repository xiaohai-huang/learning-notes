- A **propositional function** or **predicate** is a sentence that contains one or more variables.
- A predicate becomes a proposition when the variables are substituted with specific values.

## Parameters and Predicates

We can generalize **propositions** by allowing _parameters_.

**Parameters** allow us to talk generally about propositions that share a common form and meaning.

:::note Examples

- $A(x) = x\text{ is a cat}$
- $B(x,y) =$ $x$ times $y$ is 6.
- $C(x,y) =$ $x = y + 1$

:::

## Predicate versus Formula

What is the difference between _parameters_ in predicates and _letters_ in [formulas](030-propositional-logic.mdx#formula)?

- $A = \lnot (p \land q)$

  The variables in this formula ($p$, $q$) stand for propositions (which must evaluate to `true` or `false`).

- $B(x) = x \text{ is a fish}$

  Parameters ($x$) in predicates can stand for anything (usually elements from a universe set).

## Truth Values of Predicates

Before we can evaluate the truth value of a predicate we need to fill in the parameters with **actual values**.
Once we have filled **all variables** in a predicate, we can consider it as a regular proposition and has a truth value.

:::note Examples

- Given $A(x) = x^2 =1$. Then $A(1)$ is `true`, but $A(2)$ is `false`.
- Given $A(x)$ is "$x$ is a girl $\implies$ $x$ is my girlfriend". Then $A(\text{Dan})$ is `true`,
  but $A(\text{RandomFemale})$ is `false`.

:::

:::caution

Given $A(x)$ is "If $x$ is human then $x$ is mortal".
We might be tempted to say that $A(x)$ is `true`, but we cannot because we **haven't** fille in $x$ yet.

## Logic with Predicates

### Logical Equivalence with Predicates

All equivalences for Boolean formulas can be used for predicates.

- $\lnot (\forall x \, p(x)) \equiv \exists x \, \lnot p(x)$
- $\lnot (\exists x \, p(x)) \equiv \forall x \, \lnot p(x)$
- $\forall x \, (p(x) \land q(x)) \equiv (\forall x \, p(x)) \land (\forall x \, q(x))$
- $\exists x \, (p(x) \lor q(x)) \equiv (\exists x \, p(x)) \lor (\exist x \, q(x))$

### Logical Implication with Predicates

Logical implications for predicates.

- All logical implications for formulas still work. [read more](050-logical-implication.mdx)
- $(\forall x \in S \, p(x)) \land (y \in S) \models p(y)$
- $p(x) \land (x \in S) \models \exists y \in S \, p(y)$
- $(\forall x \in S \, p(x)) \land (S \not = \empty) \models \exists y \in S \, p(y)$

### Expressing Problems as Predicates

- x is prime = $\lnot ( \exists x,z \in \mathbb{N} \, ( (yz = x) \land (y \not = 1) \land (z \not = 1)   )   )$
- The above predicate is equivalent to this $\forall y,z \in \mathbb{N} \, ((yz \not = x) \lor (y = 1) \lor (z = 1))$
