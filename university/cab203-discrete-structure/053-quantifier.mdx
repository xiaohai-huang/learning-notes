**Quantifiers** are symbols that allow us to talk about parameters in predicates.

Two kinds:

- [Existential Quantification](#existential-quantification) (there exists)
- [Universal Quantification](#universal-quantification) (for all)

:::info

**Quantifiers** allow us to form **propositions** out of _predicates_
without filling in any specific value for parameters.

:::

## Existential Quantification

The _existential quantifier_ has the symbol $\exists$ and means "there exists".

$$
\exists x \in \mathbb{Z} \, (x^2 = 4)
$$

The above expression means that "There exists $x$ from $\mathbb{Z}$ such that $x^2 = 4$ is `true`".

:::tip

We don't get to known which value of $x$ works, just that some value of $x$ works.

:::note Examples
Existential Quantifiers Examples:

- $\exists x \in S \, p(x)$ means "There exists an $x$ in $S$ such that $p(x)$ is `true`".
- $\exists x \in \text{ANIMALS } \, x \text{ is a fish}$ means that
  "There exists an $x$ in $\text{ANIMALS}$ such that $x$ is a fish is `true`".
- $\exists x \in \mathbb{R} \, (x \in \mathbb{Z})$ means that
  "There exists some real number $x$ such that $x$ is an integer".

:::

## Universal Quantification

The _universal quantifier_ has the symbol $\forall$ and means "for all".

$$
\forall x \in \mathbb{Z}( x^2 \geq 0)
$$

The above expression means that "For every $x$ in $\mathbb{Z}$, $x^2 \geq 0$ is always `true`".

:::note Examples

Universal Quantifiers Examples:

- $\forall x \in S \, p(x)$ means that "For all $x$ from $S$, $p(x)$ is `true`".
- $\forall x \in \text{ANIMALS} \, (x \text{ is a cat})$ means that "For all $x$ in $\text{ANIMALS}$, $x$ is a cat".
- $\forall x \in \mathbb{Z} \, (x \in \mathbb{R})$ mean that "All integers are real numbers".

:::

## Free Parameters

Consider $A(y) = \exists x \, p(x,y)$.

- The parameter $x$ is **quantified** over, so we cannot fill it in.
- The parameter $y$ is **not quantified** over, so we can fill it in.
- $y$ is called a **free parameter**.
- The truth value of $A(y)$ depends on the value of parameter $y$.

:::info

If there are **no** free parameters, then the predicate is **fully quantified**.

:::

## Necessary and Sufficient Conditions

When $\forall x \, (p(x) \implies q(x))$ we say:

- $p(x)$ is a _sufficient condition_ for $q(x)$.
- $q(x)$ is a _necessary condition_ for $p(x)$.

When $\forall x \, p(x) \iff q(x)$ we say:

- $p(x)$ is _necessary and sufficient_ for $q(x)$.
- $q(x)$ is _necessary and sufficient_ for $p(x)$.

:::note Example

Statement: "Squareness is a _sufficient condition_ for rectangularity".

We can say that $\forall x$, if $x$ is a square, then x is a rectangle.
