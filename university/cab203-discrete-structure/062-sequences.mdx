Sometimes we care about some sets of items, but the order matters.

- Bytes in a file
- Ranked sports team in a league

We use sequences for this job. These are often implemented as _lists_ or _arrays_.

A sequence of length $n$ is a function $x : \{1 \dots n\} \implies S$ for some set $S$.

:::info

1. Sequences are often notated like $x_j$ rather than $x(j)$
2. Another notation could be `[1,5,7,1]`

## Sequences in Python: lists

```python
my_list = [1,5,6]
my_list[2] = 12
print(my_list[2])

my_list.append(8)
my_list.pop()
len(my_list)
17 in my_list
```

## Sequences in Python: tuples

see [tuples](060-relations.mdx#tuples).

## Mutability

In Python, some objects can be changed, others are static.

- mutable types can change overtime: `lists`, `dict` and, `set`.
- immutable types don't change: `tuple`, `frozenset`, `number`, and `string`

## Hashability

Hashable types can be identified by a hash value, used internally by some containers

- mutable types are not hashable
- immutable types are generally hashable
- immutable containers are hashable only if they contain only hashable elements.

:::info

Set **elements** and dictionary **keys** must be hashable.
