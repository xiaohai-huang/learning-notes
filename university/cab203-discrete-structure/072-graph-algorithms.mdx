Many computational problems can be expressed in terms of graphs:

- Finding optimal airline route.
- Determining if a network is connected.
- Determining if there is a deadlock between processes waiting for resources.
- ...and many more

## Generic Problems in Graph

- Find a Spanning Tree.
- Find a shortest path.
- Find a cycle.
- Visit every vertex in a graph by moving along edges (graph traversal).

Two generic methods for solving these problems.

- Depth-First traversal (search)
- Breadth-First traversal (search)

## Breadth-First Traversal

**Breadth-First Traversal** process the vertices in a graph in the **order of distance** from some initial vertex.

- Set $D_0 = \{u\}$ and process $u$.
- Set $D_1 =$ neighbors of $u$, and process them.
- Set $D_2 =$ neighbors of $D_1$ that we haven't seen before, and process them.
- ...
  We may not bother to keep track of the sets $D_j$.

:::tip

**BFS** tries to stay as close to $u$ as possible, only moving further away when we have visited everything close by.

### Breadth-First Traversal in Python

The visualization of the graph can be found [here](070-graphs.mdx#graph-visualization).

<CodeBlock language="python" title="_assets-07/bfs.py">
  {bfsExample}
</CodeBlock>

### Uses of BFS

- Build Spanning Tree
- Find shortest path
- Find cycles
- Find connected components
- Test if a graph is bipartite
- Find maximum flows

## Depth-First Traversal

**DFS** tries to go as far away from $u$ as possible, then backtracking when it cannot go any further.

### Depth-First Traversal in Python

The visualization of the graph can be found [here](070-graphs.mdx#graph-visualization).

<CodeBlock language="python" title="_assets-07/dfs.py">
  {dfsExample}
</CodeBlock>

### Uses of DFS

- Build Spanning Tree
- Find cycle
- Find connected components
- Maze solving
- Find a topological ordering

## Important Examples

In a situation where we have to make multiple choices. We can construct a graph (tree).

### Maze

In a maze, the set of vertices can be the "interesting" places.

- Start, End
- Places which we choose to go

We can use **Depth-First Traversal** to find a path from the start to the end.

### Game

In a game (chess, Rubik's Cube, etc.).

- Vertex: the configuration of the game
- Edge: legal move

Then **BFT** can be used to find the choices to make to get to a
winning position as fast as possible.
