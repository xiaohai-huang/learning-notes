## Building Spanning Trees

We can build spanning trees with BFS or DFS.

- The spanning trees built with BFS will contain shortest paths from initial vertex to others.
- DFS will not have this property.

### Represent Spanning Trees

Use a python dictionary `parents`.

- key: a vertex.
- value: the parent of the vertex.

### BFS Spanning Tree

General Idea:

- Use BFS to get distance classes.

## Case Study: Teleportation

## Case Study: 9P

- Vertex: game states. The arrangement of numbers.
- Edges: valid moves

### 9P instance

An instance of 9P is a start configuration.

Because there are a fixed number of items.
And each position has a special meaning i.e. the position where the number lives in the game. We use **tuples**.
