## Definition

> Predicting one thing from several things

Still fitting a line to some data, just in multiple dimensions.

The line:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \dotsb + \beta_p x_p
$$

<p style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>or</p>

$$
y = \beta_0 + \sum^p_{i=1} \beta_i x_i
$$

- Many predictors/inputs ($x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots$, x_p)
- One response/output ($y$)
- Need to find $\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \dots, \beta_p$

:::info
We aim to find values for $\beta$ that minimizes

$$
\sum^{M}_{i = 1} {(y_i - \hat{y})^2} =
\sum^{M}_{i = 1} {\left(  y_i - (\beta_0 + \sum^{P}_{j = 1} {\beta_j \times x_{ij}}) \right)^2}
$$

- $y_i$ is the actual value we are trying to predict (ground truth).
- $\hat{y_i}$ is the prediction made by the model.
- $M$ is the number of examples.
- $i$ stands for the **i**-th example.
- $j$ stands for the **j**-th attribute/dimension of an example. (e.g., wind speed, gender)
- $P$ stands for the number of attributes/dimensions of an example.
- $\beta_j$ is the weight for that attribute/dimension. It is also known as coefficient.
- $x_{ij}$ stands for the **j**-th attribute/dimension of the **i**-th example.

## Analyse a Linear Model Performance

There are many tools that can be used to measure the individual terms, and the validity of the whole model.

### Individual Terms (Coefficients)

Example data coming from [number of cyclists](https://github.com/xiaohai-huang/cab420-workspace/blob/d374f220a128ca3d544b076216b51a45d4983749/work/week1/CAB420_Regression_Example_1_Linear_Regression.ipynb) case study

```python
model = sm.ols(formula="cnt ~ atemp + temp + hum + windspeed", data=data_train).fit()
print(model.summary())
```

#### Standard Error

Definition: A measure of how much the coefficient changes by if we **resample** the data and **recompute** the regression.

#### tStat

Definition: $\frac{Coefficient}{standard Error}$ indicates that the result is less likely to be the result of noise. Therefore, we want this to be long way from **0**.

#### `p-value` {#p-value}

On an individual term, the `p-value` is the most useful. The **null hypothesis** states that the coefficient is equal to 0.

- Low p-value means that you can reject the null hypothesis. Because that term is significant and thus important to the model.
- High p-value means that the term is not significant, there are two main reasons for this.
  1. the predictor term (`input`) and the response are not related. In this case, the term shouldn't be in the model
  2. the predictor term is correlated with another predictor. Therefore, the relationship between that variable and the response is captured twice in the model.

#### Correlation

When an individual term's `p-value` is high, using correlation can help identify what's going on to improve the model. [see correlation](011-simple-linear-regression.mdx#correlation)

$R^2$ and RMSE are useful values to consider

#### R-Squared

Definition: The $R^2$ indicates how much of the observed variance explained by the model.

- **0** - the model captures/explains nothing
- **1** - the model captures/explains everything
  - **1** is the ideal performance, but **1** may also indicate overfitting.
  - The $R^2$ can only be calculated on the **training data**. but why?

Defined as follows:

- $R^2 = 1 - \frac{SSE}{SSY}$
- $SSE = \sum^n_{i=0}(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2$, SSE is the sum of the errors between the predicted and the actual value.
- $SSY = \sum^n_{i=0}(y_i - \bar{y})^2$, SSY or SST (Total Sum of Squares). Is the sum of the differences from the mean.

#### Adjusted R-Squared

Definition: Considers the model's complexity (number of terms) as well as how much variance it explains. Which means that complex models are penalized.

#### RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) {#RMSE}

Definition: **Root Mean Square Error** (RMSE) is the standard deviation of the residuals (prediction errors). It is a measure of how spread these residuals are. Therefore, smaller RMSEs are better. The scale of RMSE is dependent on the data. Unlike $R^2$, it can be computed on training, validation, and testing sets.

$$
RMSE = \sqrt{ \overline{ (prediction - actual)^2  } }
$$

```python
def compute_RMSE(predicted, actual):
    return numpy.sqrt(numpy.mean((predicted - actual)**2))
```

#### Df Residuals

Definition: The df(Residual) is the total **number of observations** (rows) minus the **number of parameters** being estimated.

#### F-statistic

Definition: A p-value used to indicate if the entire model is significant, much the same as we have for the individual terms.
