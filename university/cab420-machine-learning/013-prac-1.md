## How to Find Columns that are in Common Between Tables?

Use [Set](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_set_intersection.asp) and `set.intersection(set1, set2)` to do this. One use case is to vertically concatenate tables. Such as combine data from different years (2014, 2015, 2016) together.

`Year-2014.csv`

| Date       | Station Number | Number Cyclists |
| ---------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| 2014-01-10 | 897123         | 15              |
| 2014-03-09 | 362300         | 21              |

`Year-2015.csv`

| Date       | Station Number | Number Cyclists | Note         |
| ---------- | -------------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| 2015-01-10 | 897123         | 25              | good         |
| 2015-03-09 | 362300         | 52              | nice measure |

```python
all_columns = {"Date", "Station Number", "Number Cyclists", "Note" }
common_columns = all_columns.intersection(year_2014.columns.values,
                                          year_2014.columns.values)
```

The above code will drop the `Note` column.

:::info

Set intersection example:

```python
first       = {"c", "d", "e"}
second      = {"c", "f", "g"}
all_columns = {*first, *second} # {'c', 'd', 'f', 'e', 'g'}

result = all_columns.intersection(first, second)

print(result) # 'c'
```

## How to Convert Date String Into Datetime Object?

Use `dataframe.apply(func, axis)` or `pandas.to_datetime(data["Date"], format="%d/%m/%Y")`

### Date Information is Located in a Single Column

| Date       | Number Cyclists |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| 2014-03-22 | 91              |
| 2014-03-23 | 21              |

```python
data["Date"] = pandas.to_datetime(data["Date"], format="%Y-%m-%d")
```

### Date Information is Spread Across Multiple Columns

| Year | Month | Day | Number Cyclists |
| ---- | ----- | --- | --------------- |
| 2014 | 03    | 22  | 91              |
| 2014 | 03    | 23  | 21              |

```python
from datetime import datetime
# A new column called 'Date' will be created and its data type is datetime64
data["Date"] = data.apply(lambda row: datetime(row.Year, row.Month, row.Day), axis = 1)
```

## How to Concatenate Tables?

There are two types of concatenation. Horizontal and Vertical.

### Horizontal (left and right)

```python
pandas.merge(left,right, on="Column Name")
```

### Vertical (Stack)

```python
pandas.concat([table1, table2, table3])
```

## How to Filter Rows By Date?

For example, get the data between 2014~2018

```python
# 2014-2018
data = data[    (2014 <= data["Date"].dt.year)
             &  (data["Date"].dt.year <= 2018)
           ]
```

:::caution

- & stands for `and`
- **Operands** need to be surrounded by brackets.
