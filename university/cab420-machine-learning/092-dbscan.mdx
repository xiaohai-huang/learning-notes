# DBScan

The idea is that if a particular point belongs to a cluster, it should be near to lots of other points in that cluster.

Density Based

- Groups together points that are **closely packed**, i.e. dense
- Points that are sparse are assigned to **outliers** or **noise**.

We need to specify two parameters:

- $\epsilon$, a distance that defines how close two points should be for them to be be considered in the same cluster.
- $N_{min}$, a minimum number of points that defines the minimum number of points that should be in a cluster.

:::tip

Don't need to specify $K$.

## Definition

Core and non-core points.

A point is a **core point** if there $N_{min}$ points within distance $\epsilon$.

A point is **directly reachable** if it is within distance $\epsilon$ of a core point.

## Implications

DBScan can:

- Find arbitrarily shaped clusters, i.e. can capture highly non-linear clusters.
- Clusters can surround each other, if they are not connected. (e.g. inner circle and outer circle)
- Can label points as noise or outliers

## Drawbacks

- Sensitive to hyper-parameters
  - Incorrectly setting the distance threshold (epsilon) can lead to severe **over** or **under** clustering.
- Can't add points to clusters after clustering.
  - New points can change conductivities, which then alters the clustering results.

:::caution

trying to specify the hyper-parameters (in particular the distance threhold) can be non-trivial.

## Python

```python
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN
clustering = DBSCAN(eps=0.1, min_samples=5).fit(X)

fig = plt.figure(figsize=[8, 8])
ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1)
ax.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c=clustering.labels_);
```
