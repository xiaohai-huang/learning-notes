# Diarisation

- **Speaker Diarisation** answers the question "who spoke when"?
  - For a corpus of audio, determine which clips of audio belong to the same speaker.
- **Face Diarisation** performs a similar task for faces
  - For a corpus of video/images, group faces based on identities.

## Face Diarisation Pipeline

For all frames to process

- Run face detection
- Extract cropped faces
- Encode cropped faces to obtain an **embedding** to represent the face

Finally, **cluster** embeddings.
