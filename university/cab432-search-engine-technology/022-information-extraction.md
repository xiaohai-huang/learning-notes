## Named Entity Recognition

Create semantic annotation of text using XML tags.

### Approaches

#### Rule-Based

- Uses _lexicons_ (lists of words and phrases)
- Rules also used to verify and find new entity names

#### Statistical

Use machine learning techniques to develop rules.

- training data (manually annotated text)
- Hidden Markov Model (HMM)

#### HMM for Extraction

Resolve ambiguity in a word using _context_ (the words that around it)

a collection of transitions between states.
