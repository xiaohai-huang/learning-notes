description: What is current in physics? How to measure current flow.
---

Objectives:

- State the two laws of **electrostatic** charges.
- Define **coulomb**.
- Identify the **unit** used to measure current flow.
- Define the relationship of **amperes**, **coulombs**, and the **time** through a formula.
- Describe how current flows in a circuit.
- Describe how electrons travel in a conductor.
- Define and use _scientific notation_.
- Identify commonly used prefixes for _powers of ten_.

## First Law of Electrostatic Charges

**Like charges** repel each other. ( + repels + , - repels - )

## Second Law of Electrostatic Charges

**Unlike charges** attract each other. ( + attracts - )

## Coulomb (C)

- Represents a specific quantity of electrons.
- Unit adopted for measuring charges.
- $6.24 \times 10^{18}$

## Current (I)

Electrical current is the flow of electric charge.

In a conductor, the moving particles that carry the electric charge are **electrons**.
They drift from the ➖**negative terminal (excess of electrons)** toward the ➕**positive terminal (lack of electrons)** when a voltage (potential difference) is applied.

## Amperes (A)

- Unit of measure for current. It measures the **rate** at which electric charge flows. Think of it as the "flow rate" of the charge.
- It tells us how much charge flows through a wire every second.
- 1 **ampere** = 1 **coulomb** of charge passing a point in 1 second.

The relationship between amperes and coulombs can be expressed as:

$$
I = \frac{Q}{t}
$$

Where:

- $I$ is the current in amperes (A).
- $Q$ is the charge in coulombs (C).
- $t$ is the time in **seconds** (s).

:::success

Tip: cover the element you want to get.

- $Q = I \times t$
- $I = \frac{Q} {t}$
- $t = \frac{Q} {I}$

```css

```

:::

- Milliampere (mA) = 1/1000 A or 0.001 A
- Microampere (µA) = 1/1,000,000 or 0.000001 A

## Voltage (V)

- Supplies electrons from one end of the conductor.
- Removes electrons from the other end of the conductor.
- The difference in potential between two points in a circuit is called the **voltage** (V).

## Scientific Notation

- Use **single-digit** number plus powers of 10 to express and small numbers.

## Prefixes

- $10^3$ is called **K, kilo**
- $10^6$ is called **M, mega**
- $10^9$ is called **G, giga**
- $10^{12}$ is called **T, tera**

- $10^{-3}$ is called **m, milli**
- $10^{-6}$ is called **$\mu$, micro**
- $10^{-9}$ is called **n, nano**
- $10^{-12}$ is called **p, pico**
