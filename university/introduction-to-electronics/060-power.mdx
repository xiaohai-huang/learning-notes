# Power

## Learning Objectives

- Define **power** in the context of electric circuits.
- Describe the relationship between **voltage (V)** and **current (I)** and their role in power.
- Use and manipulate the basic power formulas to compute power consumption.
- Compute power in **series**, **parallel**, and **series-parallel** circuits.
- Explain passive sign convention and interpret positive/negative power.
- (Advanced) Recognize power concepts for AC circuits: instantaneous, average, apparent, reactive power, and power factor.

## Quick Definition

**Power** is the **rate of energy transfer** — how quickly electrical energy is converted into another form (heat, light, mechanical work, etc.).

- Instantaneous power (time domain): $$p(t)=v(t)\,i(t)$$
- For steady DC, power is constant and measured in **watts (W)**.
- Energy is the integral of power: $$E=\int P\,dt$$. For constant $$P$$, $$E=P\cdot t$$ (Joules).

## Core Formulas (DC / Instantaneous)

1. Basic:

   $$
   P = V \times I
   $$

2. Combine with Ohm's law ($$V=I\,R$$) to get:

   $$
   P = I^2 R \qquad\text{and}\qquad P=\frac{V^2}{R}
   $$

3. For time-varying signals (instantaneous):

   $$
   p(t) = v(t)\,i(t)
   $$

   Average power over time $$T$$:

   $$
   P_\text{avg} = \frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T} p(t)\,dt
   $$

## Units and Prefixes

- 1 watt (W) = 1 joule/second.
- Common prefixes: mW (10⁻³ W), W, kW (10³ W), MW (10⁶ W).
- Horsepower: 1 hp ≈ 745.7 W.

---

## Passive Sign Convention

- If current **enters** the terminal of an element labeled with the **positive** polarity of voltage, then $$P=V\cdot I$$ is **positive** → the element **absorbs** power (consumes).
- If $$P<0$$, the element is **supplying** power (a source).
- Conservation: In any complete circuit, algebraic sum of powers = **0**.

## Power in Series and Parallel Circuits

### Strategy

1. Simplify the circuit (series/parallel reduction).
2. Find total current/voltage.
3. Work back to find currents/voltages on each element.
4. Compute power ($$P=VI$$, $$I^2R$$, or $$V^2/R$$).
5. Verify conservation of power.

### Series Circuits

- Current is the same: $$I=I_\text{series}$$.
- $$P_i = I^2 R_i$$.

### Parallel Circuits

- Voltage is the same: $$V=V_\text{parallel}$$.
- $$P_i = \dfrac{V^2}{R_i}$$.
